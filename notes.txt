including spritify.py.. 

the generator is triggered automatically every time the render.animation button is pressed.
-it runs over the .png files rendered to the root folder. 
-it produces a sprites.gif and sprites.png

idea: 
write a simple python script with a list of all the required sprites, including for each one:
-name
-frame ini
-frame end
-frameskip 
- camera to use? angle for the camera? parent object for the camera?

for each required script, set the properties.render window attributes, and fire the render.anim button.
after that, copy and rename the sprites.gif and sprites.png to a final folder with the name of the desired anim.
finally, delete all the temporal pngs in order to prepare things for the next iteration.

render the current frame to a unnamed .png file 
bpy.ops.render.render(write_still = True)
